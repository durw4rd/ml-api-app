# Reading from Mavenlink API

Not necessary to know all of this but thought I'd list some concepts that are useful to understand to make sense out of this:
* [Understanding and using REST API](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/) - in case you're not familiar with what is discusses here, highly recommend to read the article
* Node.js basics. There's plenty tutorials, I don't think it's necessary to do like a full course but it helps to get some sense what it is. [This](https://nodejs.dev/learn) content is directly from the ppl maintaining Node (I don't know if it's good).
* HTTP methods used by RESTful APIs (GET, POST, PATCH,...) - covered in the first article
* Promises & async-await functions in JavaScript
* Template literals / template strings
